# Firebase Migration Notes

This folder prepares the Travel Planner project for a future Firebase Firestore migration.

The current CakePHP application still uses MySQL through CakePHP ORM. Moving the whole application to Firebase is not a one-line configuration change because the controllers and table classes currently depend on SQL tables, joins, and CakePHP entities.

## Current Migration Step

The current MySQL data has been exported into Firestore-friendly JSON files:

```text
firebase/firestore-data/
```

Each MySQL table is exported as one JSON file. Each item uses this shape:

```json
{
  "document_id": "1",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example"
  }
}
```

The `document_id` can be used as the Firestore document id. The `data` object can be stored as the document data.

## Export Again

Run this command from the project root:

```bash
DB_NAME=3047travelplannerproj DB_USER=3047travelplannerproj DB_PASS=password /opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.3/bin/php scripts/export_firestore_json.php
```

## Firebase Project

The matching Firebase project for this app is:

```text
travelplanner-yt-260528
```

The Firestore database uses Native mode in the `australia-southeast1` region.

## Import Into Firestore

Run this command from the project root after getting a Google OAuth access token:

```bash
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=travelplanner-yt-260528 FIREBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token /opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.3/bin/php scripts/import_firestore_json.php
```

The import script reads `firebase/firestore-data/manifest.json` and writes each JSON file into a Firestore collection with the same name.

## Suggested Firestore Collections

- `users`
- `flights`
- `hotels`
- `packages`
- `enquiries`
- `payments`
- `reservations`
- `reservation_results`
- `flight_data`
- `hotel_data`
- `package_data`
- `services`

## Recommended Next Step

After the data is in Firestore, migrate one module at a time. A safe order is:

1. Read-only travel search data
2. Flight, hotel, and package lists
3. Enquiry form
4. Booking and payment records
5. Authentication migration

This keeps the project usable while Firebase support is added gradually.
